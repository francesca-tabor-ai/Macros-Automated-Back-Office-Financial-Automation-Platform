I want to create a Python script for financial back-office automation.

The script should:

1. Open a file picker to select an Excel file (.xlsx or .xls).
2. Read the Excel file, which has columns: Date, Description, Amount, Category.
3. Clean the data:
   - Remove empty rows
   - Convert 'Amount' to numeric
   - Convert 'Date' to proper datetime format
   - Fill empty 'Category' cells with "Uncategorized"
4. Validate the data:
   - Flag transactions where Amount is missing or <= 0
   - Flag transactions where Date is missing
5. Summarize the data:
   - Group by 'Category' and sum the 'Amount'
6. Export a new Excel file with three sheets:
   - "Cleaned_Data" → the cleaned dataset
   - "Summary" → the summarized totals by category
   - "Issues" → all flagged problematic rows
7. Automatically name the output file with timestamp like: financial_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx
8. Print messages in the terminal to show progress, like "Processing file..." and "Report generated successfully".

Write clean, beginner-friendly Python code that uses pandas, openpyxl, and Tkinter for the file picker. Include comments explaining each step.
